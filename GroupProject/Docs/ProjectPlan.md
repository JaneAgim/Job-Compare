|Business Modeling| This RUP discipline aims to identify the business stakeholders and their needs. As such, this activity involves producing a project charter|Business presents problem statement|Target audience is understood, project resources are identified, and project charter is created|

|Analysis & Design| Use cases are generated for analysis. This gives way to the design document, which consists of architectural, class and component models. Here, we present all project assumptions, identify constraints on the system and define our system environment. We then precise which components will be used in this environment and how they come together in the system, in order to achieve the project goal|Requirements Document| Use case and design documents are generated|
|Implementation| In this phase, the components specified in the Analysis & Design RUP activity are implemented and the coding process begins, in order to create the application|Analysis & Design completed|Application generated|
|Testing| This activity is conducted as an iterative process in order to investigate whether the implemented components abide by the requirements and constraints set out for us|Both during and after RUP Implementation|System tests complete|
|Deployment| This final step allows for the tested application to be released and made available to its target audience|Testing phase completed|Application release|
