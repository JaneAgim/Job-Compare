# Test Plan

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

To properly test our application we will be leveraging a hybrid testing strategy that will include unit testing, integration testing, and regression testing methods. In addition, we will use static verification and inspection methods to ensure that knowledge is shared across the team in conjunction with our other automated tests. Further, we will also hedge consolidating testing to one team member and share this responsibility across the team.

### 1.2 Test Selection

As stated, we plan to leverage multiple testing strategies. Further detail is outlined below:

**Unit Testing**  
Core components of the class diagram will contain relevant unit tests to validate that class methods and data are working as expected. Additionally, unit testing will occur within the UI to ensure that users are not able to pass incorrect data to improve the user experience.

To achieve this, we are going to leverage a white-box testing strategy where the developer responsible for writing the unit tests is not the same individual that was responsible for the code. This separation of responsibilities forces a knowledge share point and serve as one the inspection aspects of our overall testing strategy. Additionally, this interaction will help ensure that implementation assumptions are clarified.

**Integration Testing**  
From a system view, we plan on using a white-box strategy where testing as well. In addition, manual workflow testing will be conducted to validate application changes and compliment the automated unit tests. 

**Inspection Testing**  
As mentioned, in addition to our automated testing, we plan on conducting code reviews as part of the testing process. This ensures that knowledge is shared across the team and implementation decisions and assumptions are not consolidated to any one individual.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

Testing coverage is our primary metric for the adequacy of our testing strategy. By focusing on covering the breadth of units and interactions of services, we think we can strike an appropriate balance of risk mitigation without delaying development and release timing.  

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

The team plans to manage bugs and enhancements through a shared [spreadsheet](https://gtvault-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/djerow3_gatech_edu/EdDnH1lQTTZMu2NEVa-ktnkBgbD7PSPT-fE6cJphlCShbQ?e=xmek67). This will provide centralized resource for all members of the team to access and report issues and potential enhancements.

### 1.5 Technology

We will use JUnit for unit testing and integration.
